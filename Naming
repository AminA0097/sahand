Columns start with FLD_ + field name
Letters must be capitalized
Use underscore _ between words
Example:
private String fieldOne;
@Column(name = "FLD_FIELD_ONE")

Method Names Should Start With A Lowercase Letter For The First Word,
And The First Letter Of Each Subsequent Word Should be Uppercase (camelCase)
Example:
findUsername();

Classes in Java should be named using PascalCase (each word starts with a capital letter).
Example:
UsersEntity

Database table names are usually all uppercase with underscores separating words.
